OpenWaters is a simulation tool made in Unreal Engine for generating massive underwater computer vision datasets. OpenWaters supports creation of massive amount of underwater images by emulating diverse real-world conditions. It allows for fine controls over every variable in a simulation instance, including geometry, rendering parameters like ray-traced water caustics, scattering, and ground-truth labels.
